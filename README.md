# SDLion (NOT UNDER DEVELOPMENT ANYMORE)

SDLion is a Lua library for creating graphical applications using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library. It provides a simple interface for creating windows, rendering graphics, and handling user input. It just makes lua-sdl2 a lot easier




## Development

Keep in mind that this project is in work, so if you want to see code, then it is in main branch but there is no 'full version' of this project! I'm working hard to make first alpha version of it!


## Installation

Make sure you have SDL already installed and this is what you also need to install:


```bash
  luarocks install lua-sdl2
```
To get this into your project, you just get this repository into your directory by running these command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dimkauzh/SDLion
  cd SDLion
```
To test if it works just run this:
```bash
  lua example.lua
```


## Documentation

Coming soon when project is fully done
